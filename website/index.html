                <p>The new NHS and social care system has seen a shift of power away from central Government, towards local health and care systems desperate to ensure they are clinically and financially sustainable.</p>
                <p>Increasingly, the whirlwind of digital and data driven advances, such as blockchain, real world data and AI, are seen as part of the solution, meaning organisations are fighting to occupy a crowded and complex space.</p>
                <p>Lexington Health Local can help you understand, navigate and connect with local health and care systems and local tech ecosystems to better achieve your business goals.</p>
